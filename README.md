# CodeIt Online Tutor
The purpose of this tool is to walk students through AppInventor tutorials
that have been broken up into smaller chunks and separated by "Checkoffs".
In order to receive a Checkoff and move onto the next section, students must
go to their mentor and answer a series of questions correctly.

The benefits of the Checkoff process include:
 - making sure students reflect on their learning at each step (metacognition)
 - allowing mentors to check for student understanding
 - providing a built-in mechanism for students to approach mentors with questions

A prototype of the online tutor can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SEtAzrTZ4IEq7hIkd_fDM2Jj-7k-jamO0gPUwODWT-U/edit?usp=sharing).

## Developer Tools
The plan is to use [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/database/)
to store and sync data corresponding to the Checkoffs received by each student.

[Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting/) seems to be
the easiest option for hosting our web app.

**For Newbies:** The [Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/)
is a helpful tutorial for getting a feel for how Firebase products are used.

## Tutorials in Google Doc Format
The AppInventor tutorials are also in the process of being rewritten to fit
the Online Tutor format. This [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B5IUIXywN7x1OHdLY1ZOZjR0dVE)
contains drafts of the tutorials in Google Doc format.
